I've been claiming as a full-stack web developer for years, ever since my first job where I learned deeply to work with SQL, ASP.NET, jQuery and JavaScript. I learned jQuery in 2016 (yep, a bit late), it was my first impression about the dynamite web frontend. I also learned a bit of AngularJS and Shopify Liquid template thanks to the VirtoCommerce project that I shortly involved.

Later in 2020, I shortly worked as a backend developer, and that was the time I learned about Linux, Docker, Message Queue, and DevOps. It is obvious that only a high throughput system have demands for skillful backend developers. That was the first time I learned about the importance of the backend system.

Later in 2022, I shortly back to the full-stack path again, but this time I took the lead in web development introducing React, TypeScript, React-Admin, React-Query, SignalR, EF Core and more to the team. Not going to detail what happened later, just list a few things here for the record:
- communication is the key to succeed while picking up a new framework
- framework is replaceable, while the core domain knowledge is not (from "Clean Architecture")
- the popularity and learning resources of a framework is important
  - should always consider the size of the community
  - also consider if the framework is well-known enough for the generative AI to kick in
- UX is important, but the UI is somehow expendable

I've doubted about how UI is expendable, but in the recent months, the idea has become clearer to me in the following aspects:
- UI is the first impression, but the content is the core
- use Kano Model to explain, UI is close to exciters where content is closer to must-haves
  - in a limited resource scenario, should always aim for complete all the musts to pass the basic quality
  - the concept is similar to YAGNI and "Premature Optimization Is The Root Of All Evil"
  - bonus: developing an applicationn without the concrete content, context and requirements is also regarded as YAGNI
- furthermore, it is quite challenging for a full-stack developer to build nice looking UI efficiently
  - a dedicated designer or a frontend developer is more likely to master such work

Besides UI, it turns out that CI/CD and DX share the same attributes. In other words:
- the source code is the content
- the functions or features are the near to must-haves where DX is near to exciters
- it also required dedication and commitment to reach mastery

Extra rule of thumb for picking up the right tools
- use one framework or design system at a time
  - know your requirements and pick up the good primitives is the key to succeed
- Know your requirements earlier if possible
  - it is time-consuming found out if the tool does not meet all the needs in the middle
  - consider the cost of: finding workarounds, tampering the source code, paid features, or even finding the next suitable tool
  - thus, it is hard to make the right decision
    - high level abstraction tool are easy to use, but customization might be tough
    - sometimes, it is easier to use low level tools with good primitives and the help of generative AI to achieve your goals
- although libraries are easier to scope and replace
  - it is recommended stick with one at a time to avoid bloated dependecies and benefit from consistency

All these observation and experience were based on the following events:
- develop a homemade ERP to a small business instead of using an existing ERP
- stumble on headless or framework agnostic design while developing a POC app from scratch
  - hugely modifying an open source library instead of using it directly
- develop a personal productivity app without building a concrete usage routine first
- overly customize a default website theme instead of choosing a well-designed theme, and then, tweak as needed

It is easier to deal with if the same thing would happen again, but the difficulties of mastering UI, DX or product development remains the same.
One may say it's "learn development the hard way". I don't have an answer to overcome these problems for now, however, "fail fast" seems good enough to be the answer.
I susposed it is a good strategy for a full-stack developer to keep finding and trying new things with short iteration, optimally, one may find their own niche and strengths in the process.
Here's some oppotunities I haven't tried yet:
- glue LogSeq and LibreOffice with a data converter (to benefit from the table editing experience from LibreOffice)
- connect astro frontend with a headless backed (e.g. LogSeq, WordPress, Odoo...)
- use local LLM to analyze notes
- use n8n to introduce other interface and then streamline some of the works mentioned above

Hopefully one of the work could be the happy path for a "full-stack developer" career ðŸ¤“

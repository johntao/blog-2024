In recent weeks, I've immersed myself in understanding LogSeq's relationship system, aiming to unlock better ways of managing and analyzing interconnected knowledge. While this research has yielded valuable insights, it's crucial to pause and critically evaluate my approach.

### Research Journey

My investigation began with a fundamental question: How can I better understand the relationships between my notes in LogSeq? This sparked a series of explorations, from examining different types of relations to developing advanced query techniques. Along the way, I created a custom notation system for describing page and block relationships, complemented by a weighting system for different relation types. The final piece was developing a metric to evaluate topic contributions within my notes.

However, this critical review has revealed several areas requiring attention:

### Methodological Challenges

**Minor Issues:**
- Academic Rigor: The research relied heavily on personal observations without a formal methodology
- Documentation Consistency: The notation system and Mermaid diagrams varied across blog posts
- Weighting System Design: The mixing of qualitative and quantitative metrics complicated result interpretation, when a simpler multiple-key ordering approach would have sufficed

**Fundamental Issues:**
1. Research Focus Misalignment
   - The core goal of evaluating topic contributions was overshadowed by an excessive focus on page and block relationships
   - The concept of "contribution" remained undefined, preventing proper topic evaluation
   - The relationship analysis should have supplemented, not dominated, the topic evaluation process

2. Validation Gaps
   - No systematic validation against real-world data or alternative approaches
   - Insufficient peer review or expert consultation

3. Goal Definition
   - The research objective "contributions of topics" lacked precise definition
   - Success metrics were not established at the outset
   - The scope remained too broad and ambiguous

### Moving Forward

While the topic contributions research remains intriguing, I've decided to temporarily shift focus to more immediate priorities:

1. Client-Facing Development:
   - Building and launching a demo website for potential clients
   - Gathering user feedback and requirements

2. Tool Development
   - Creating a personal productivity plugin for LogSeq
   - Focusing on practical user needs

3. Community Engagement
   - Supporting the Odoo bookclub community
   - Addressing user challenges and gathering real-world use cases

When I return to the research, I'll approach it with:
- Clear, measurable objectives
- A robust methodology including validation mechanisms
- Regular peer review and community feedback
- Systematic documentation and consistency checks

### Another Research Direction

Besides digging to "measuring contribution of certain topic", there's also another interesting aspect on how to progressively build up a concrete piece of knowledge.  
This is something about designing the workflow of building up a record.  
From what I known, a simple example would be something like this:
1. flicker notes (usually written in the journal)
2. digest flicker notes into pages (i.e. persistent note)
3. publish to web as an article

What makes it so interesting is that in the previous research, I introduced different types of data relations in LogSeq, these types form into different routes, thus, it is possible to introduce more steps between step 1 and step 2.  
We then, could discuss how many viable workflows exist, and what would be the best approach.

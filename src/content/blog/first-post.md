Greetings, Web! This is my second blog built with Jamstack. While my [previous blog](...) is now archived, this new iteration represents a fresh start with some key changes:

| Aspect               | Current Blog | Previous Blog           |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Language            | English      | Traditional Chinese     |
| Topics              | Various      | Blog Development Focus  |
| SSG Framework       | Astro        | Next.js                |
| Hosting Platform    | Cloudflare   | Vercel                 |
| Styling Solution    | TailwindCSS  | Template-based         |

## Why Another Blog?

The motivations for starting and stopping a blog often remain the same. However, two major factors influenced this restart:

1. **Language Confidence**: Unlike my previous blog in the pre-GPT era, I'm now comfortable writing in English after 2+ years of practice. The emergence of AI tools has also helped boost my confidence in English writing ü§ì

2. **Technical Evolution**: The frontend ecosystem has expanded significantly, sometimes intensifying my decision paralysis (Next.js ‚Üí Svelte ‚Üí Solid ‚Üí Lit ‚Üí WebC ‚Üí HTMX ‚Üí Alpine... üòµ‚Äçüí´). While everyone has their reasons for choosing specific technologies, here's why I chose Astro:

- **Performance-First**: Built for optimal content delivery, perfect for blogging
- **Flexible Architecture**: Uses island architecture, allowing seamless integration with major frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular (effectively curing my decision paralysis)
- **Strong Documentation**: Including Starlight, a dedicated documentation framework
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Offers [extensive plugin support](https://astro.build/integrations/) for popular toolchain integration
- **Developer Experience**: Features an engaging CLI with personality (‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)

## Future Plans

### Content
I plan to share insights about:
- Frontend development
- Odoo and ERP systems
- Generative AI for personal productivity
- Knowledge management

### Technical Improvements
The site will gradually evolve with features like:
- Search functionality
- Content filtering
- Table of contents
- And more!

I'm excited about creating this content and hope you'll find value in it. Let's see how far this journey takes us! üöÄ

Greetings Web! Here comes the second blog of mine built with Jamstack. The [previous one](...) is sort of archived.  
The major difference is that:
| : Comparison         : | : Now     : | : Then                : |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Blog Post Language     | English     | Traditional Chinese     |
| Blog Post Topics       | Various     | How I built my blog     |
| SSG                    | Astro       | Next.Js                 |
| Host                   | Cloudflare  | Vercel                  |
| Styling                | TailwindCSS | Blog Template Starter   |

For blogging aspect, I think the reason for start blogging and stop blogging is probably the same.  
The only difference is that when I started the previous one, it was pre-GPT era.  
With GPT-boost, I am comfortable written in pure English, plus, I've already practicing English writing for 2yrs+ 🤓  
For technical aspect, the frontend ecosystem has normally extended my decidophobia to new degree (i.e. Next.js > Svelte > Solid > Lit > WebC > HTMX > Alpine... 😵‍💫)  
Everyone can have their reasons to choose or not to choose at this point.  
Here's some reasons for me to choose Astro:
- Fast by default, focus on content delivering, suit for applications as simple as blogging
- Island architecture, able to integrate with major frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular if needed (effectively cure my decidophobia)
- Well documented, have a dedicated framework 'Starlight' for building a documentation site
- [Healthy plugin systems](https://astro.build/integrations/) allowing developers to integrate their site with popular toolchain
- lastly but not least, they have cool looking CLI XDD

## Aspirations

For blogging aspect, I would like to share topics that I'm interested with such as frontend development, Odoo and ERP, generative-AI on personal productivity, and knowledge management.  
For technical aspect, I would progreesively enhance the website with more features like searching, filtering, and table of content.  
I'm enjoying making these contents, and hope you'll find something interesting.  
Stay tune. Let's see how far can I go this time 🚀

In the past few weeks, I've been working on a variety of projects, including a deep dive into LogSeq's relationship system. This research has been enlightening, but it's time to take a step back and review my progress.

### Research Review

The research began with a simple question:  
How can I better understand the relationships between my notes in LogSeq?  
This led to a series of blog posts exploring the different types of relations and how to query them using advanced queries.  
Then, I introduced a notation system for describing relationships between pages and blocks as well as a weighting system for different relation types.  
The last piece of the puzzle was to make a metric to evaluate the contributions of topics in my notes.  
However, I realized that I needed to take a step back and review my progress. There were several issues with this research that needed to be addressed:

Minor issues
1. Lack of academic rigor: The research lacked a formal methodology and relied heavily on personal observations.
2. Inconsistencies in notation and diagrams: The new notation system and Mermaid diagrams were not consistently applied across all blog posts.
3. The weighting system was obviously flawed: The system was mixed with qualitative and quantitative metrics, making it difficult to interpret the results.
   - and also, the formulas were not needed at all, a simple multiple keys ordering would have sufficed (first primary factor, then secondary factor).

Major issues
1. Incorrect research direction: The intention was to evaluate the contributions of topics in my notes, but the research focused more on the relationships between pages and blocks.
   - which is an obviously wrong direction, as the relationships between pages and blocks are a small part of evaluating the topics
   - I should first have defined what I meant by "contribution" and then evaluated the topics based on that definition
   - after that, I could have looked at the relationships between pages and blocks to see if they could help optimize the previous evaluation
2. Lack of validation: it is crucial to validate the metrics and evaluation system with real-world data or different approaches.
   - which is a major issue, as the research could be completely wrong and I would have no way of knowing
   - I should have at least consulted with someone who has experience in this field to validate my approach
   - or I could have used a different approach to validate my results
3. And the most important issue: the goal of the research was not clearly defined.
   - I should have clearly defined what I wanted to achieve with this research and how I would measure success
   - "contributions of topics" is too vague, I should have defined what I meant by "contribution" and how I would measure it

### Moving Forward

Although it is tempting to dive back into the "contributions of topics" research, I would hold off on the research for now and focus on other projects. Such as:
1. hosting a demo website for my potential clients
2. working on a personal productivity plugin for LogSeq
3. solving users' issues on the Odoo bookclub community

I will revisit the research in the future, but this time with a clear goal and a well-defined methodology. I will also validate the results with real-world data and different approaches to ensure the research is accurate and reliable.

In [Part 2](/blog/evaluate-notes-via-relations-pt2), we explored how to query basic relation types using advanced queries in LogSeq. This continuation delves into weighting these different types of relations.

### Important Notes

During the development of the weighting system, I discovered several defects in the previous relationship listings. While I attempted to use new notation and Mermaid diagrams to cover all cases, this proved to be time-consuming. I've decided to focus on the main content for now, with updates to Parts 1 and 2, including new notations and diagrams, coming in the future.

### First-Degree Relations

First-degree relations represent direct connections between elements in LogSeq. The new notation system is structured as follows:

**Notation Format:** `{node} {relation}`  
- **Node:** 'P' for page, 'B' for block
- **Relation:** Indicates the relation type, where the second letter indicates the destination element type
- **Example:** `P MP` means a page has a reference to another page in metadata

First-degree relations include:
- P MP: Page references another page in metadata
  <details>
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
      subgraph 1P[Page 1]
         1Pp[tags:: page-2]
      end
      1P~~~1P2([&Page 2])
   ```
  </details>
- P UP: Page belongs to a parent page
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR;
      1P["Page 2 (parent)"]-->1C["Page 1 (child)"];
   ```
   </details>
- P DP: Page has a child page
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR;
      1P["Page 1 (parent)"]-->1C["Page 2 (child)"];
   ```
   </details>
- P PB: Page has a block
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   subgraph 1P[Page 1]
      1Pb[Block 1]
   end
   ```
   </details>
- B CP: Block references a page in content
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
   subgraph 1B[Block 1]
      1Bp[#page-1]
   end
   1B~~~2P([&Page 1])
   ```
   </details>
- B CB: Block references another block in content
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   flowchart LR
   subgraph 1B[Block 1]
      1Bb[#block-2]
   end
   1B~~~1B2([&Block 2])
   ```
   </details>
- B UB: Block belongs to a parent block
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR;
   1P["Block 2 (parent)"]-->1C["Block 1 (child)"];
   ```
   </details>
- B DB: Block has a child block
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR;
   1P["Block 1 (parent)"]-->1C["Block 2 (child)"];
   ```
   </details>
- B BP: Block belongs to a page
   <details>
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   subgraph 1P[Page 1]
      1Pb[Block 1]
   end
   ```
   </details>

### Second-Degree Relations

Second-degree relations represent indirect connections derived from combining two first-degree relations.

**Notation Format:** `{link type}{node} {1st relation} {2nd relation}`
- **Link Type:** 
  - '~' for serial (order-dependent)
  - '=' for parallel (order-independent)
- **Example:** `=P MP MP` represents a page with two interrelated page references in metadata

Categories of second-degree relations:
- OIR: Order Interchangeable Refs
   - `=P MP MP`
   - `=B CP CP`
   - `=B CP CB`
   - `=B CB CB`
- DBE: Dereference a block then extend
   - `~B CB BP`
   - `~B CB CP`
   - `~B CB CB`
   - `~B CB UB`
   - `~B CB DB`
- BDP: Start from block, dereference a page then extend
   - `~B CP BP`
   - `~B CP MP`
   - `~B CP DP`
   - `~B CP PB`
- PDP: Start from page, dereference a page then extend
   - `~P MP UP`
   - `~P MP DP`
   - `~P MP MP`
   - `~P MP PB`
- 1BB: A block lineal relation + a block ref
   - `~P PB CB`
   - `=B CB DB`
   - `=B CB UB`
- 1BP: A block lineal relation + a page ref
   - `~P PB CP`
   - `=B CP DB`
   - `=B CP UB`
- 1PP: A page lineal relation + a page ref
   - `~P UP MP`
   - `=P UP MP`
   - `=P PB MP`
- 2LD1: Two lineal relations of same node-type with depth of 1
   - `=P DP DP`
   - `=B DB DB`
- 2LD2: Two lineal relations of same node-type with depth of 2
   - `~P UP UP`
   - `~B UB UB`
- 2LPB: Two lineal relations of different node-type
   - `~P DP PB`
   - `~P UP PB`

### Methodology and Research Notes

The evaluation methodology combines quantitative and qualitative factors:

1. **Primary Factors** (Scale 1-3):
   - Usage frequency (quantitative, based on personal usage data)
   - Dereference complexity (qualitative, the less the better)

2. **Secondary Factors** (Scale 1-5):
   - Relation specificity (quantitative, based on maintenance cost)
   - Lineal relation (qualitative, prefer parent relation type)

The final evaluation score uses the formula: `primary^3 * secondary^1` to appropriately weight the factors while preventing edge cases where high secondary scores might overshadow primary importance.

### Conclusion

This research establishes a foundational framework for evaluating second-degree relationships in LogSeq, offering several key contributions:

1. A quantitative baseline for determining correlations between second-degree relationships, enabling more efficient discovery of indirectly related topics
2. A unified, succinct notation system for describing complex relationships between pages and blocks, providing a solid foundation for future research
3. A novel approach to relationship metrics that considers both direct and indirect connections, allowing for more comprehensive topic analysis

These advances open new possibilities for knowledge graph analysis and relationship-based content organization in LogSeq and similar tools.

### Research Notes and Methodology Insights

This initial research effort presented several interesting challenges and learning opportunities:

**Notation Development**
- The development of a concise notation system emerged as a crucial first step
- The concepts of "serial" and "parallel" relationships proved valuable, providing geometric equivalents based on directional attributes
- While the notation is efficient, future work should address additional geometric variants of relationship types

**Evaluation Framework Design**
The evaluation methodology was developed through a systematic approach:

1. Relationship Grouping
   - Similar relations were clustered to establish coherent categories
   - Secondary factors were evaluated within group contexts (scale 1-5)
   - Primary factors were assessed globally (scale 1-3)

2. Scoring System
   - Implemented the formula `primary^3 * secondary^1`
   - This approach successfully prevents edge cases where high secondary scores (e.g., 1 primary, 5 secondary) might inappropriately outweigh more significant relationships (e.g., 2 primary, 1 secondary)
   - Balances quantitative data with qualitative insights

**Future Research Directions**
- Incorporate additional academic references to strengthen the theoretical foundation
- Expand quantitative analysis with formal data collection and validation
- Explore automated tools for relationship analysis based on this framework
- Develop standardized metrics for relationship evaluation across different knowledge management systems

This research represents a first step toward a more rigorous understanding of knowledge graph relationships, with significant potential for expansion and refinement in future work.

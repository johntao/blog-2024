In [Part 2](/blog/evaluate-notes-via-relations-pt2), we explored how to query the basic relation types using advanced queries in LogSeq. This continuation delves into weighting these different types of relations.

### Important Notes

During the development of the weighting system, I found out a few defects of previous relationship listing. I tried to use new notation and mermaid diagrams to cover all the cases, however, it is a time-consuming process.  
I've decided to skip those parts and focus on the main content. Stay tuned for the updated version of part1 and part2 plus new notations and diagrams.

### First-Degree Relations

First-degree relations represent direct connections between elements in LogSeq. I'll use new notation to represent these relationships.  
Notation: `{node} {relation}`  
Node: 'P' for page, 'B' for block  
Relation: indicate the type of the relation, the second letter of the relation type indicates the type of the destination element.  
e.g. `P MP` means a page has a ref of another page in metadata
Here's the list of first-degree relations:
- P MP: Page has a ref of another page in metadata
- P UP: Page belong to a parent page
- P DP: Page has a child page
- P PB: Page has a block
- B CP: Block has a ref of a page in content
- B CB: Block has a ref of another block in content
- B UB: Block belong to a parent block
- B DB: Block has a child block
- B BP: Block belong to a page

### Second-Degree Relations

Second-degree relations represent indirect connections between elements in LogSeq. These connections are derived from combining two first-degree relations.  
Notation: `{link type}{node} {1st relation} {2nd relation}`  
Link Type: indicate the type of the link, either serial '~' or parallel '='  
p.s. a parallel link means the order of the relations is interchangeable, while a serial link means the order is significant.  

e.g. `=P MP MP` means a page has two page-refs in metadata and they are related to each other.  
Here's the list of second-degree relations:
- OIR: Order Interchangeable Refs
   - `=P MP MP`
   - `=B CP CP`
   - `=B CP CB`
   - `=B CB CB`
- DBE: Dereference a block then extend
   - `~B CB BP`
   - `~B CB CP`
   - `~B CB CB`
   - `~B CB UB`
   - `~B CB DB`
- BDP: Start from block, dereference a page then extend
   - `~B CP BP`
   - `~B CP MP`
   - `~B CP DP`
   - `~B CP PB`
- PDP: Start from page, dereference a page then extend
   - `~P MP UP`
   - `~P MP DP`
   - `~P MP MP`
   - `~P MP PB`
- 1BB: A block lineal relation + a block ref
   - `~P PB CB`
   - `=B CB DB`
   - `=B CB UB`
- 1BP: A block lineal relation + a page ref
   - `~P PB CP`
   - `=B CP DB`
   - `=B CP UB`
- 1PP: A page lineal relation + a page ref
   - `~P UP MP`
   - `=P UP MP`
   - `=P PB MP`
- 2LD1: Two lineal relations of same node-type with depth of 1 (in the shape of V)
   - `=P DP DP`
   - `=B DB DB`
- 2LD2: Two lineal relations of same node-type with depth of 2 (in the shape of 1)
   - `~P UP UP`
   - `~B UB UB`
- 2LPB: Two lineal relations of different node-type
   - `~P DP PB`
   - `~P UP PB`

### Weight and Evaluation

The weight of a relation is determined by the following factors:
- Primary
   - value range from 1 to 3
   - higher usage frequency (quantitative)
      - based on my personal case
   - less dereference (qualitative)
- Secondary
   - value range from 1 to 5
   - higher specificity (quantitative)
      - specificity is determined by the maintenance cost of the relation
   - higher lineal relation (qualitative)
      - a parent relation is more specific than a child relation

### Conclusion

With this evaluation in mind, we're now having a baseline to determine the correlation of second-degree relationship which help discover indirectly related topics more efficiently.  
Also, this is the very first attempt to describe a complex relation with a unified succinct notation. A concise notation is the bedrock to conduct more researches efficiently in the future.  
Lastly, we can now build metrics of a topic that has a better coverage on indirect relations.

### Footnotes

It is the very first time I tried to conduct this type of research.  
The first challenge is to set up a good notation to describe relation types.  
I realized the concepts of "serial and parallel", geometric equivalent based on direction attributes.  
Although the notation is concise, we still need to bear in mind for geometric variants of a certain relation type.  
The second challenge is to design reasonable factors to evaluate each relations.  
I try not to dive into the abyss in the process, hence, I mix some quntitative facts with subjective point of views.  
First group similar relations together, then, evaluate the secondary factor in the scope of group with value range from 1 to 5.  
Finally evaluate the primary factor in global scope with value range 1 to 3.  
The final score is calcuate with a formula (i.e. `primary^3 * secondary^1`) that could mitigate edge case such that a case of (primary: 1, secondary: 5) would not surpass (primary: 2, secondary: 1).  
Hopefully, I could have more academic references in the next research, also consolidate the quantitative portions with formal data references.
